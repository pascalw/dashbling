Dashbling is a React based tool for creating beautiful dashboards.

Features:

* Widgets are React components that automatically update when data changes.
* Data can be pushed into your dashboard via a REST API, or fetch data using small NodeJS modules.
* Looks great out of the box, or fully adapt to your taste.
* Great developer experience with hot reloading, ES2015+ and Sass.
* Extensible build system powered by Webpack.
* Can easily be hosted on Heroku, and platform supporting Docker.
* Widgets can easily be shared via NPM packages.
